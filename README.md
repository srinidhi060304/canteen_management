# canteen_management
This program was done by me and my team as a project. It is about a simple management system where we used sqlite for the database in SQLite. The database includes 4 cities under which are 4 major databases.
5star,4star,3star hotels and sightseeing places are the 4 major database under each city(bangalore,mumbai,delhi and chennai).
Under the hotels we have tables that have column headings with name, 2people,3people and 4 people(price per night for each).
Sight seeing places have column headings of name,tag,start time, end time, number of hours required, adult entry fee and child entry fee.
We then use logic and tkinter for the calculations and gui of the project.
